Welcome! My name is Zou Chenxuanyin and I am a graduate student in Northeaster University in Liaoning province and currently studying for my Master's degree.

<br><br>
My research focuses on multiobjective optimization, semi-infinite programming, and optimal control. I am currently trying to incorporate parallel and distributed computation into my research to intensify the power to solve large-scale and complicated problems and improve efficiency. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://zcxy.github.io/research" target="_self">research page</a> and my <a href="https://zcxy.github.io/research" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!
